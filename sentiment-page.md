# Sentiment Analysis

## Part 1: The mourning visualised 

The first aim was too study the sentiment of all of the tweets in our database, over time. After cleaning all of the tweets, and reducing them to their bare core, a database of happy words scoring by MIT was used. It's also interesting to see the "influencial" tweets and if they are connected to the popular opinion at all.

This visualisation confirms the hyopthesis that popular tweets are not only **more emotional**, but also seem to module the popular opinions by some degree. 

Another interesting fact is to see the "week" mark (when 150 hours go by) and to see how the overall sentiment is one of **mourning**.
